			Hello everyone and welcome to my first HTML5 & CSS3 page. The reason I created this page is to practice my skills.  These few pages are going to be devoted to one of my favourite hobbies, cupcake baking.
			The website is divided into 6 sections. This is the home section. At the About section, I will tell you a bit about how it all started. The Menu section is to present the cupcake menu with all the different cupcakes you can order.
			The Gallery section is going to host some of my best creations, while in Order Now! you will be able to make an order for your cupcakes, whether it is for a party, a wedding or for personal consumption.
			You can contact me through the info at the Contact section.
